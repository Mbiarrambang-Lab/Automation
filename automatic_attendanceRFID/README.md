## YOUR PROJECT TITLE :Smart Attendance Management System (SAMS) with RFID

## Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

## Description:
This project implements an Automated RFID-Based Student Attendance System using an Arduino microcontroller. 
Students possess unique RFID tags, each pre-registered with their identity in the system. 
When a student presents their tag to the RFID reader, its unique ID (UID) is instantly scanned. The Arduino then processes this UID, 
comparing it against a list of authorized student IDs stored within its memory or on an SD card.

Upon a successful match, a Real-Time Clock (RTC) module accurately timestamps the attendance record, capturing the exact date and time.
This crucial attendance data (UID, timestamp, status) is then securely logged to an SD card for persistent storage and later retrieval. 
Simultaneously, an LCD display provides immediate visual feedback, showing "Welcome [Student Name]" or "Access Denied." 
A buzzer also provides audible confirmation. This ensures efficient, error-free, and real-time attendance tracking for educational environments.

Eventualy i would advance this to send this data to cloud storage to be accessed any where by the school authorities and also upgrade the project by making the Tag's UID editable(using the school'n UID)


Thank's
