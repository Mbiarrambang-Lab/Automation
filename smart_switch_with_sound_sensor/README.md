Project tittle: Sound-Activation Device Control

Video Demo: <URL HERE>

Description : 

    This project develops a Sound-Activated Device Control system.
    It uses an Arduino microcontroller and a sound sensor.
    The system detects specific audible triggers, like a clap.
    It employs millis() for non-blocking, reliable event timing.
    A debouncing mechanism prevents unintended rapid toggles.
    The prototype successfully switches a simulated device (relay turns on Lamp) ON/OFF.
    This offers a convenient, hands-free method for device interaction.
    It's a foundational step towards accessible and smart home automation.
